<p class="paragraphs" style="left: 0%; padding: 5px;"> The Drotuce is an organization that helps people achieve greatness. <br> "DRotUCE" is an acronym that stands for (The) Democratic Republic <br> of the United Communist Empire. This acronym demonstrates that <br> the Drotuce has many forms of government, with no ties to any <br> specific one. One major goal for the Drotuce would be to acquire a <br> large quantity of land, and with any luck, establish a small country. <br> All you have to do to become a citizen is enroll in the Drotuce. There <br> are several ways to do this, but the most direct is to contact one of <br> the High Council Members, either in person or through email. The <br> Drotuce has two national languages: English, and the Drotucian <br> Language, known as Drotucian. What we do in the Drotuce is just <br> hang out and have fun and make money so we can become a country. <br> <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_United_and_Continuous_Empire"> our microwiki! </a> </p> </p>

<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The DRotUCE is run mainly by an eight-person body called the  <br> High Council. These Councillors, as they are known, each head a House in the DRotUCE - similar to branches of government, but more extensive. The Houses are Justice (responsible for the lower court systems), Militia (responsible for the military and police), <br> Treasury (responsible <br> for the running of the economy), Espionage (responsible for foreign <br> intelligence operations and domestic procedures such as background <br> checks), Marketing (responsible for advertisement of the country and its <br> products), Industry (responsible for the production of said products <br>), Medicine (responsible for the health and wellness of citizens), and <br> Education (responsible for the education of citizens). There is also a <br> ninth spot on the High Council, reserved for the PRHC, or People’s <br> Representative on the High Council. This individual is elected by <br> citizens, and is able to vote in matters that would usually be Council-only.<br> <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://drotuce.fandom.com/wiki/Drotuce_Wiki"> our fandom! </a> </p>

<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The DRotUCE’s currency, the Rouble, is similar in appearance to poker chips, being rounded coins of varying colors, with symbols on the top and bottom. The value of the Dona - otherwise known as the red rouble, the lowest value coin - is equivalent to that of one US cent, and their value is based on color, with red Dona being the lowest and black Dalo being the highest. Not every coin is named, however; only the red (Dona), green (Dema), and black (Dalo). The names are based on the Drotucian words for bronze, silver, and gold. <br> <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_United_and_Continuous_Empire"> our microwiki! </a> </p>
