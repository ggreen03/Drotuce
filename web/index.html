<p class="paragraphs" style="left: 0%; padding: 5px;"> The Drotuce is an organization that helps people achieve greatness.  "DRotUCE" is an acronym that stands for (The) Democratic Republic of the United Communist Empire. This acronym demonstrates that the Drotuce has many forms of government, with no ties to any specific one. One major goal for the Drotuce would be to acquire a  large quantity of land, and with any luck, establish a small country. All you have to do to become a citizen is enroll in the Drotuce. There  are several ways to do this, but the most direct is to contact one of the High Council Members, either in person or through email. The Drotuce has two national languages: English, and the Drotucian Language, known as Drotucian. What we do in the Drotuce is just hang out and have fun and make money so we can become a country. <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_United_and_Continuous_Empire"> our Microwiki! </a> </p> </p>

<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The DRotUCE is run mainly by an eight-person body called the  High Council. These Councillors, as they are known, each head a House in the DRotUCE - similar branches of government, but more extensive. The Houses are Justice (responsible for the lower court systems), Militia (responsible for the military and police), Treasury (responsible for the running of the economy), Espionage (responsible for foreign intelligence operations and domestic procedures such as background checks), Marketing (responsible for advertisement of the country and its products), Industry (responsible for the production of said products), Medicine (responsible for the health and wellness of citizens), and Education (responsible for the education of citizens). There is also a ninth spot on the High Council, reserved for the PRHC, or People’s Representative on the High Council. This individual is elected by citizens, and is able to vote in matters that would usually be Council-only <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://drotuce.fandom.com/wiki/Drotuce_Wiki"> our Fandom! </a> </p>

<div style="position: relative; left: 20%;background-color: #919191; width: 60vw; border-radius: 20px;">
<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The DRotUCE’s currency, the Rouble, is similar in appearance to poker chips, being rounded coins of varying colors, with symbols on the top and bottom. The value of the Dona - otherwise known as the red rouble, the lowest value coin - is equivalent to that of one US cent, and their value is based on color, with red Dona being the lowest and black Dalo being the highest. Not every coin is named, however; only the red (Dona), green (Dema), and black (Dalo). The names are based on the Drotucian words bronze, silver, and gold. <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_United_and_Continuous_Empire"> our Microwiki! </a> </p>

<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The Drotucian culture is heavily influenced by that of America, but its language is a mix of corrupted English words, Gaelic- or German-style words, and completely original creations. The majority of the unique culture comes from their internet presence, which is arguably stronger than their live one; their Discord server is their main source of members, and thus influences it more than anything else.  <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_United_and_Continuous_Empire"> our Microwiki! </a> </p>

<div style="position: relative; left: 20%;background-color: #919191; width: 60vw; border-radius: 20px;">
<p class="paragraphs" style="padding: 5px; left: 0%;"> The structure of the Drotucian government includes a system of government branches, known as “Houses”. There are six houses, each headed by a member of the High Council of the Drotuce. The six are as follows:
<br>
<br>
1. The Federal House of Daniel, headed by the High Emperor
<br>
<br>
2. The Militant/Religious House of Teodore, headed by Emperor Teo
<br>
<br>
3. The Monetary House of Rider, headed by Emperor Rider
<br>
<br>
4. The Secretive House of Andrew, headed by High King Andrew
<br>
<br>
5. The Industrial House of Brian, headed by High King Brian
<br>
<br>
6. The Propagandistic House of Emir, headed by High King Arber
<br>
<br>
Each house has a separate role in the running of the country. Every month, the house leaders receive an amount of roubles in proportion to the number of members training in their house to use as funding for their own projects. At the annual Council Conclaves, the house leaders meet to discuss matters of their house and the Drotuce as a whole, as well as to socialize and whatnot.   <p style="font-family: arial;font-size: 1.5vw; position: relative; left: 27%; font-weight: normal;">Read more about this on <a style="" target="_blank" href="https://drotuce.fandom.com/wiki/Drotuce_Wiki"> our Fandom! </a> </p>
